## Private Training

Stark & Wayne is one of the leaders in enabling and encouraging companies to run Cloud Foundry themselves.

### Attendees

There are many assumptions in the workshop that each attendee has a background or experience in "ops" or "sysadmin" work environments; and understands the goals of devops practices. Linux system administration background is ideal.

### Requirements

Each attendee should bring a laptop with an ssh program. Preferably each laptop is an OS X/Unix/Linux machine, with Ruby 1.9.3+ installed.

The training facility will require public Internet access. Each attendee will require access to the target infrastructure to be used for running Cloud Foundry.

The training facility will also require whiteboards. You cannot not discuss internal networking configurations without a whiteboard. Post-it notes are optional.

Currently supported infrastructures for training are:

* Private OpenStack
* AWS

Please discuss with us your infrastructure and venue requirements before committing to training workshops.

### Continued Learning

Existing Stark & Wayne customers can request continued learning workshops.
